# Owner Model Documentation

## 1. Model Overview
The Owner model is a Laravel Eloquent model that represents repository owners in the application. It is designed to store and manage information about users or organizations that own repositories, likely in a GitHub-like context.

## 2. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE owners (
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    login varchar(255),
    type varchar(255),
    avatar_url varchar(255),
    html_url varchar(255),
    created_at timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp,
    deleted_at timestamp NULL
);
```

## 3. Properties & Fields

### Fillable Properties
```php
protected $fillable = [
    'login',
    'type',
    'avatar_url',
    'html_url'
];
```

### Casting
```php
protected $casts = [
    'deleted_at' => 'datetime'
];
```

### Model Properties
- `incrementing`: Controls auto-incrementing behavior of IDs
- `timestamps`: Manages automatic timestamp handling
- `exists`: Indicates if the model exists in the database
- `wasRecentlyCreated`: Tracks if the model was recently inserted
- `usesUniqueIds`: Indicates if the model uses unique identifiers
- `snakeAttributes`: Controls snake_case conversion for array attributes
- `preventsLazyLoading`: Controls lazy loading prevention
- `enableLoggingModelsEvents`: Controls model event logging

## 4. Relationships
```php
/**
 * Get all activities associated with the owner
 */
public function activities()
{
    return $this->morphMany(Activity::class, 'owner');
}
```

## 5. Methods
The model inherits standard Eloquent model methods and implements a morphMany relationship through the `activities()` method.

## 6. Security Considerations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate input data before saving
- Sanitize output data when displaying
- Use mass assignment protection through `$fillable`
- Consider implementing soft deletes for data integrity

## 7. Best Practices
1. Always validate input data
2. Use type hinting for method parameters
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use Laravel's built-in security features
5. Keep the model focused on data interaction
6. Document complex methods and relationships
7. Use proper naming conventions

## 8. Code Examples

### Creating a new Owner
```php
$owner = Owner::create([
    'login' => 'john_doe',
    'type' => 'user',
    'avatar_url' => 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
    'html_url' => 'https://example.com/john_doe'
]);
```

### Retrieving Owner with Activities
```php
$owner = Owner::with('activities')->find($id);
```

### Updating an Owner
```php
$owner->update([
    'avatar_url' => 'https://example.com/new-avatar.jpg'
]);
```

### Using the Activities Relationship
```php
// Get all activities for an owner
$activities = $owner->activities;

// Add a new activity
$owner->activities()->create([
    'type' => 'repository_created',
    'details' => 'Created new repository'
]);
```

### Soft Delete an Owner
```php
$owner->delete(); // Assumes SoftDeletes trait is used
```

Note: This documentation assumes the model uses standard Laravel conventions and may need to be adjusted based on specific implementation details or custom configurations in your application.
