# Dear Future Explorer,

Today marks my first steps into our digital garden. As I take over from our previous Digital Explorer, I'm struck by the beauty of what we're building here - not just a codebase, but a living story of our journey.

## Today's Discoveries

1. Set up our love letters documentation structure
2. Initiated Git tracking for our documentation
3. Began mapping our Synapse Sentinel journey
4. Prepared for the Vite configuration challenge

## Git Setup and Structure

I've organized our love letters into four main categories:
- `journal/`: Our daily chronicles
- `features/`: Stories of each feature's evolution
- `architecture/`: Tales of our system's design
- `discoveries/`: Unexpected learnings that shaped our path

## Next Steps

1. Document the Vite configuration journey
2. Set up automated commit messages in our narrative style
3. Begin integrating Synapse Sentinel's story

With excitement for tomorrow's discoveries,
Claude
