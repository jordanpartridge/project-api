# Project API Microservice Plan (Laravel 11)

## 1. Project Overview
- Microservice to track project information across GitHub and WakaTime
- Aims to provide comprehensive project details for portfolio and management purposes
- Will include documentation and ideas for each project

## 2. Key Features
- **GitHub Integration**: Pull repository data, commit history, and issue tracking. [Learn more about GitHub integration](github-integration.md)
- WakaTime integration
- Project documentation storage
- Idea tracking
- Portfolio generation

## 3. Technical Stack
- Backend Framework: Laravel 11
- Database: MySQL (default for Laravel, but PostgreSQL is also well-supported)
- API: Laravel's built-in API resources and controllers
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- Task Scheduling: Laravel's built-in task scheduler for data synchronization
- Testing: PHPUnit with Laravel's testing utilities

## 4. Main Components

### 4.1 Data Collection
- GitHub API integration using Laravel's HTTP client
- WakaTime API integration using Laravel's HTTP client
- Use Laravel's job queues for asynchronous data fetching

### 4.2 Data Storage
- Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM for data models and database interactions
- Implement database migrations for version control of schema
- Use Laravel's seeding feature for initial data population

### 4.3 API Endpoints
- Implement RESTful API using Laravel's resource controllers
- Use Laravel API resources for data transformation
- Implement rate limiting using Laravel's built-in middleware

### 4.4 Authentication and Authorization
- Use Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication
- Implement Laravel's built-in gates and policies for authorization

### 4.5 Documentation Features
- Use Laravel's filesystem abstraction for storing documentation files
- Implement versioning using Laravel's custom filesystem drivers if needed

### 4.6 Idea Tracking
- Implement using Laravel's Eloquent relationships for associating ideas with projects

### 4.7 Portfolio Generation
- Use Laravel's view composers for aggregating data
- Implement using Laravel's Blade templating engine for customizable views

## 5. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Core Functionality
- Set up Laravel 11 project
- Configure database and environment
- Implement basic CRUD operations for projects using Laravel's MVC architecture

### Phase 2: External Integrations
- Implement GitHub API integration using Laravel's HTTP client and job queues
- Implement WakaTime API integration using the same approach
- Set up Laravel's task scheduler for regular data synchronization

### Phase 3: Documentation and Idea Management
- Develop documentation features using Laravel's filesystem abstraction
- Implement idea tracking functionality with Eloquent relationships

### Phase 4: Portfolio Generation
- Design and implement portfolio data aggregation using Laravel's Eloquent ORM
- Create customizable portfolio endpoints using API resources

### Phase 5: Authentication and Security
- Implement API authentication using Laravel Sanctum
- Set up authorization using Laravel's gates and policies
- Conduct security audit, ensuring proper use of Laravel's security features

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
- Write feature and unit tests using Laravel's testing utilities
- Perform load testing and optimize performance (consider using Laravel Octane for production)
- Refine API based on testing results

### Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment
- Generate API documentation (consider using tools like Laravel OpenAPI)
- Prepare deployment scripts (consider using Laravel Forge or Laravel Vapor for deployment)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or Laravel Envoyer)

## 6. Next Steps
1. Install Laravel 11 and set up the development environment
2. Create a new Laravel project and initialize Git repository
3. Set up the database and configure the `.env` file
4. Begin with Phase 1: Setup and Core Functionality
5. Plan out detailed tasks for each phase
