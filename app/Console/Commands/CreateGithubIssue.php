## Overview
Our AI-generated model documentation is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Time for some upgrades!

## Current Limitations
- **Prompt Structure**: Simpler than a "Hello World" program
- **Generation**: One pass? That's like painting with one brush stroke.
- **Business Context**: As vague as a politician's promises
- **Examples**: Could be more engaging than a tax form
- **Accuracy Check**: What accuracy check?

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
```php
$enhancedPrompt = <<<EOT
Analyze and document the {$modelName} model with flair:

1. **Core Purpose & Business Context**:
   - Why does this model exist? (Hint: Not just for show)
   - Workflows it powers
   - Integration points

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Why did we choose this schema? (Was it a coin toss?)
   - Performance - because time is money
   - Validation - no garbage in, no garbage out
   - Common pitfalls - so we can avoid them

3. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Real-world use cases (Think beyond "it works on my machine")
   - Query optimization - because slow is the new no
   - Transaction handling - because life's transactions are messy
   - Event patterns - not just for Christmas

4. **Testing & Quality**:
   - Test scenarios - because we love edge cases
   - Data integrity - keep the data honest
   - Edge cases - where the bugs love to hide
